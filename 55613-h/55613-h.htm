<h3>THE MENDI MISSION.</h3>

<h4>SUGGESTIONS, WITH EXTRACTS FROM JOURNAL.</h4>

<p class="secauth">REV. H.&nbsp;M. LADD.</p>

<p>Much of the mission work in Africa, at least upon the West Coast,
has a basis in industrial work of some kind. Many causes have
conspired to hinder this branch of civilizing work at the Mendi
Mission. Without stopping to specify what these may have been,
no one can doubt that the chief reason why the saw-mill at Avery
has failed to be a source of income to the Association, is the
difficulty of transporting the lumber to market. This mill, with
a circular and an upright saw, with a good head of water during
the larger part of the year, and with timber near at hand, is the
only mill of the kind on the West Coast. There is a good demand for
such lumber as the mill can produce, but the chief market is 120
miles distant. No one in Africa, however much he might want lumber,
would be guilty of going 120 miles for it, nor even 120 rods, if
he could help it. In former times the lumber was taken to the
market in a large boat, propelled by oar and sail; but the climate
and the worms have claimed that boat as their own. Here is a most
potent agency, an attractive centre for goods. The mill might be
producing thousands of feet of lumber a day, and yet if there were
no way to carry this lumber to the point where it could be sold,
its production would only become a burden. What is needed to insure
the best success of the mill, and of all the industrial departments
connected with it, is an easy and quick means of transportation.
This would not only make the mill a really civilizing institution
and a paying piece of property, but if a small steamer or tug-boat
were thus in use, it would more than pay its own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span> way in the
regular trips it would make, and by the incidental services it
could render to other mission stations where similar industrial
work is carried on. There are promises enough to insure the
successful running of such a steamer. It should be adapted to
towing a lumber boat of large capacity to and from Freetown, and
should also be adapted to carrying passengers up and down the
rivers. It would accomplish more work in a given time than any
other project yet proposed on this coast, would dispense with the
small army of boatmen and fleet of boats now maintained, and would
be the solution of the question in regard to the mill. But why keep
up this mill? Why have an industrial department? Simply because the
spiritual interests of the mission are involved in it and demand
it. There must be a physical basis for any successful work upon
the minds and hearts of the people in this part of Africa. This
has been demonstrated in other missions than our own. The people
need a place to tie to, and something to draw them to that place
in order to receive any lasting good. They need to learn habits of
industry along with the Gospel. They need to be lifted out of their
barbarism by increasing their wants and showing them how to supply
them.</p>

<p>These are a few of the considerations that make this industrial
work a sort of entering wedge for the Gospel. The situation of
things at the Avery Station is, however, such as to convince
those who have considered the matter, that the keen edge of this
entering wedge must be the sharp prow of a little steamer. There
can be scarcely a doubt, that the facilities afforded by such a
steamer would give a much needed impetus to the whole work of the
Association upon the West Coast.</p>
</div>

<div class="article">
<h4>JOHN BROWN MEMORIAL STEAMER.</h4>

<p>Here is now an opportunity to turn to account the latent forces
that lie pent up within easy reach. But how shall the steamer
preach its practical sermon unless it be sent? Some one must send
it. Many hands make light work, especially when they contain the
contributions of willing hearts. Why may not the many little
rills, and springs, and even drops of love for the colored race,
flow together and float this steamer? Why not send, as some one
has suggested, old John Brown, of Harper’s Ferry, in a memorial
steamer over to Africa, to carry forward in a higher sense the work
of freedom which he began here, and which shall never end till
his soul has ceased its marching on? About $10,000 are needed to
furnish such a steamer as is required. Who will take the first $100
share in the steamer “John Brown” soon to leave for the coast of
Africa?</p>
</div>

<div class="article">
<h4>ADVANCE TO THE INTERIOR.</h4>

<p>If we may believe one-half of the glowing accounts which come to us
regarding the high table-lands of the interior, one or two hundred
miles back from the coast, the region is full of rich promises
as the scene of future missionary operations. It is said that
the land is rich, the country wonderfully beautiful and healthy,
the population dense, and cattle and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span> horses abundant. There are
difficulties in the way of reaching this country, but they are
not insurmountable. One of our missionaries (Mr. Williams), well
fitted for the work, has pushed his way back into this region, and
reports very strongly in its favor. He brought back a horse with
him as corroborative evidence of his statements, and there can be
no doubt that in this healthier upland region the natives are more
intelligent, more industrious, and every way superior, while they
are also ready to welcome any who come among them for purposes
of peace. Our present stations upon the coast, three in number,
furnish excellent starting points and bases of supply, and should
be maintained largely as such. But it should be our aim to work
back from the low, malarious coast into these healthier and more
promising highlands just as soon as the proper men and the means
can be found. Starting from the stations already established, it
would seem to be a wise thing to locate a chain of stations within
easy distances of each other, stretching back to the mountains.
At these points the missionaries could reside two by two, with
mutual helpfulness and support. The natives of this region talk
the same general language as upon the coast. They are said to be
remarkably fine singers, and are fond of music. They manufacture
great quantities of cloth and various other articles of a superior
quality. They are, however, reported to be the husbands of many
wives, counting their honors by the number of their wives. The
rivers that drain this region afford an imperfect approach to the
country, but are available for considerable distances. Let the
means and the men be found, and this healthier and more promising
country can soon be captured for Christ. It is only a question of
time. This push for the interior must soon be made, and a larger
and better work must soon be inaugurated.</p>
</div>

<div class="article">
<h4>BRIEF EXTRACTS FROM THE JOURNAL.</h4>

<p>On Wednesday, March 23d, we sighted the point of Sierra Leone by
early dawn. The country as approached from the sea is beautiful.
The serrated Lion Mountains slope to the water’s edge, covered
with a luxuriance of tropical vegetation. The city of Freetown at
a little distance appears comparatively well built. The public
buildings are large and attract immediate attention, the streets
are wide and regularly laid out; and the whole external aspect
strikes one as much finer than what is naturally expected on this
coast; but a nearer view suggests the truth of the old saying that
“Familiarity breeds contempt.” The stay here was short, but into
the time was crowded a variety of strange and novel experiences.
From this point the mission boat “Olive Branch” carried us to
Good Hope Station, on Sherbro Island, where we landed late in the
evening of March 30th. This trip of about one hundred and twenty
miles occupied three days and two nights, and was, perhaps, the
most trying part of our journey. We experienced several severe
tornadoes on the way, and suffered from the intense glare of the
sun, now nearly vertical, and the difficulty of procuring proper
food. Having reached the mission house, we at once made ourselves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
as much at home as possible. Thursday, March 31st, we were all
up at an early hour, and went out before the intense heat of the
day to inspect the grounds and buildings. The fine property of
the mission had evidently suffered in many ways from neglect. All
the buildings stood in need of repairs, and a large portion of
the grounds, including the little cemetery where Barnabas Root is
buried, was overgrown with bush. The spiritual condition of the
church and station seemed also to bear some resemblance to its
outward condition. It was not hopeless, but somewhat depressed.
The grounds in the immediate vicinity of the mission house gave
evidence, however, that the missionaries had neither forgotten to
exercise their taste, nor been wasteful of the small force and
slender means at their command. So, also, the spiritual condition
of the station presented some encouraging features. The warm
reception which Mr. Kemp and his wife received on every side gave
some reason to hope that the church would yet nourish under his
judicious care.</p>

<p class="caption">MISSION HOME, MENDI MISSION.</p>
</div>

<p>Friday, April 1st, was emphatically a day of calls. It had been
quickly noised abroad that the new missionaries from America had
arrived, and many availed themselves of the first opportunity to
bid them welcome to Africa. Possibly a little curiosity was mingled
with their politeness, but we did not care to analyze too closely,
and were glad to see them all. The people we met were generally
fine looking, of a rich, brown color, and not burdened by any
superfluity of clothing. They talked a broken English, which was
almost as difficult to understand as a new language.</p>

<p>To say that Sunday, April 3d, was a warm day would convey but a
slight idea of the truth. When the thermometer indicates over 90°
in America we are apt to call it rather warm; but a new adjective
is needed to characterize African heat at 90°, for it is something
so entirely different from the summer broils of other countries.
No wonder that this is an unhealthy climate. The land is low, the
water stagnant, the air moist, vegetation thick, and the heat
intense. In the morning I preached in the mission church to an
attentive audience on “The light that shineth in a dark place,” and
was present at a service in the Mendi language at the school-house
in the afternoon. The prayer meeting in the evening was well
attended and full of interest.</p>

<p>On Monday, April 4th, we went in the “Olive Branch” to Avery
Station, on the Mahna River, a branch of the Bargroo, forty miles
inland. The trip took all of one night, the boatmen rowing and
keeping time to their oars with a weird, monotonous singing all the
way.</p>

<p>The inspection of the station at Avery consumed the early morning
hours of Tuesday. We visited the mill, the boat houses, the coffee
farm, the cassada fields, the rice houses, the boy’s department,
the store, the church and school-room, and last, but not least, the
“faki,” or native village, situated on the mission grounds, and
under the control of the missionary. The situation of the mission
house is a fine one, but the adjacent country is wilder than at
Good Hope. The house stands on a high promontory,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span> and commands
a very picturesque view both up and down the river. This river
abounds in fish and alligators, while the banks are alive with
monkeys.</p>

<p>I was up at three <span class="smcap lowercase">A.&nbsp;M.</span> on the 7th to help receive Mr.
Kemp, who arrived from Good Hope Station at that hour. Later we
visited the school together, examined the pupils in their various
branches, and gave them a little talk, which they seemed to enjoy.
Some of them were honored by such names as Wm. E. Gladstone and M.
E. Strieby. Their appearance and behavior were very gratifying. The
prayer meeting in the evening was fully attended, and indicated a
marked degree of earnestness, the leader having some difficulty
to bring it to a close. If hand-shaking is a means of grace, we
enjoyed special privileges at the end of this meeting.</p>

<p>I found oysters growing on trees (April 8th), and plucked a large
branch. Bread and butter also grow on trees in this strange land.
I had occasion to turn doctor to-day, and prescribed some fearful
doses, right and left, with marked results, due probably to faith.</p>

<p>After the ordination exercises at Good Hope (April 10th), a number
of the ministerial brethren of the council went in a boat-load
to attend service at the out-station of Debia, and although a
severe tornado threatened to break up the meeting, we enjoyed an
interesting and precious season together. The work at this point is
full of encouragement, but greater facilities are needed to carry
it on.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The painful news has just been received through Rev. O.&nbsp;H. White,
D.D., of London, of the death of Rev. Kelly M. Kemp at Good Hope
Station, Mendi Mission. Thus one more bright name has been added
to the long list of missionary heroes and martyrs whose dust
hallows the soil of Africa. No particulars have been received,
and we cannot speak confidently as to the cause of his death.
Those who have read the recent accounts of his ordination and
reception at Good Hope need not be reminded of the high hopes
that were entertained in regard to the work upon which he had but
just entered with so much zeal. Mr. Kemp’s earnest consecration
and varied experience and sweet Christian character had not only
endeared him to all who knew him, but had given rich promise also
of great good to the people among whom he had counted it all joy to
labor.</p>

<h3>FREEDMEN FOR AFRICA.</h3>

<p class="secauth">REV. LEWIS GROUT.</p>

<p>The Freedmen, properly educated, will make capital missionaries for
Africa. After a careful study of the race for thirty years—fifteen
on their own ancestral shores, and now fifteen in this land of
ours—such is my conclusion concerning them. They have, naturally,
some of the best traits to fit them for mission work. They are
hopeful, for one thing, as every missionary should be. During all
the long years of their bondage, and then during all the war, how
did they hope on and hope ever that deliverance would come, till
come it did! They are naturally a social people. Getting a new
idea, a new truth, they talk it over, pass it on, keep it going.
The missionary must be social, if he will do the most good. They
are a sharp-minded, quick-witted people. For ability to read
character, make a quick turn, a good use of passing events, or take
a good illustration from nature, the Africans have no superiors.
They are of a tropical constitution, most happy, healthy, and
most at home in just such a climate as that of Africa. It is
their native clime—a fact whose value can neither be denied nor
over-estimated.</p>

<p>Now keeping all these natural qualifications in mind, let us
briefly notice some pertinent points in that most unique, varied
experience and divinely appointed discipline through which God, in
His providence, has been causing the Freedmen to pass for all these
years, as giving them a yet more special preparation for the great
mission work He has in store for them.</p>

<p>First, experience in suffering. I know not how it may be with
others, but for myself I have come, long since, to think that there
is no discipline in this world like that of suffering, rightly
used, to fashion us after the image of the Divine. In this way the
Saviour himself is said to have been made perfect and fitted for
His great redemptive work, (Heb. v., 8, 9). And when, in olden
time, God would make choice of a people to be conservators and
propagators of His truth in the world for ages, how did He prepare
them for their mission? Not by sending them to college, but by
sending them down into Egypt; and there, for long generations,
did He keep them in bondage, and then for other long years in
wanderings in the wilderness, till He had fitted them for His
work, and ground into them a character which all the fiction of
the ages has not yet ground out of them. So with the people of
whom we speak—what an experience have they had in suffering!
Surely, God must have in store for them some great and wondrous
mission, for which He has intended this experience to be both
presage and preparation. Then notice the discipline they have had
as soldiers in the camp, on the march, on guard, in the battle,
shoulder to shoulder with our men, sons, brothers, fathers, bravely
fighting for the Union, that they might know what war is, and
what it sometimes costs to secure liberty and save a nation from
anarchy and ruin. See, too, what experience and discipline they
are getting in civil and political life, in the use of the ballot,
in the forming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span> and reconstructing of states, in the framing of
constitutions, in making and executing laws, in all the varied and
complicated duties of citizens, magistrates, judges and rulers,
that they may know how laws, states and nations are made and
sustained, and so be prepared to go and plant these institutions
and principles in the land of their fathers. And then, last and
best of all, what an experience are they getting in the work of
organizing and running Christian schools and pure churches among
their own people, under the lead of our teachers and preachers in
the South, that they may be prepared to do this same blessed work
in that dark land which is so imploringly calling to them, as her
own sons and daughters, to come with the school and the church to
her help.</p>

<p>I love to look at the work of the American Missionary Association
in this Divine light. I love to come up in this way upon these
highlands of God’s movements in Africa, and among her sons on our
shores in this our day, and to get, as I think I can, in this way,
some good look at the sweep and the purpose of His providence
in the otherwise strange revolutions through which Africa, the
Africans, and we ourselves are so swiftly passing.</p>

<p>And now, what is wanting to bring this divinely planned enterprise
to a speedy and glorious consummation, but that we do all come
quick and glad into line with God?—that the Freedmen, the American
Missionary Association, all its noble constituency of churches, the
whole rank and file of God’s American army, tread firm and true to
the music of His providence? So shall be generously furnished the
men and the means He now asks, by which to hasten, in His time, the
redemption of Africa unto Himself.</p>

<h3>ADDRESS AT NASHVILLE,</h3>

<h4>AT THE LAYING OF THE CORNER-STONE OF LIVINGSTONE MISSIONARY HALL.</h4>

<p class="secauth">BY SECRETARY STRIEBY.</p>

<p>As we are about to lay the corner-stone of a new school building,
it is proper that I should answer the question, Why do we come down
from the North to erect these buildings in the South?</p>

<p>Before answering the question, I may say that if we come at all,
it is not strange that we should select so beautiful a spot as
this for a location; nor that we should come to Nashville, for
there seems to be some sort of educational lodestone that attracts
schools to this city. Joshua conquered a Moabite city called
Kirjath-sepher, which scholars tell us means “Book City.” What
could have given it that title in that remote era, whether the
possession of one book or several books, when letters had probably
not long been invented, must remain forever a mystery. So when
Macaulay’s New Zealander, after having meditated on the ruins
of London Bridge, shall come to this spot and meditate upon the
ruins here, or when some Layard or Cesnola or Schliemann shall dig
down deep into their foundations, this place may be denominated
the “School City;” for at the earliest date<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span> of the settlement of
Nashville, good schools were formed, and now the hill-tops are
crowned and the streets are adorned with schools of the highest
character. Nor are these for the white race alone. The Methodist
Central Tennessee College, the Baptist Normal and Theological
Institute, and neither last nor least, Fisk University, crowning
these heights, attest the interest taken in the Christian education
of the colored race.</p>

<p>But why do we come here from the North to build these buildings?
First, we come as fellow-citizens, who have shared in the agony of
the late civil conflict, at the bottom of which lay negro slavery,
and for which North and South were responsible, though it may be
in different degrees. In the piping hot days of the anti-slavery
contest, the Evangelical Alliance met in London. An English
gentleman took the platform and delivered a scathing rebuke to
America for slavery. Dr. Cox, our most celebrated off-hand orator
of that day, took the floor, saying that of course America had
her view as to who was responsible for negro slavery in America,
whether Britons or Americans; “but,” said he, “I propose to take
one corner of the mantle, and let the brother who has just spoken
take the other corner, and we will walk backwards and throw it
over the originator of negro slavery in America.” We come as
fellow-citizens in a like spirit, ready to throw the mantle of
charity over the past. But emancipation has introduced a new
element. The ex-slaves need Christian education and elevation, and
we come as Christian brethren and say to our friends at the South:
We will take one corner of the mantle of Christian education, if
you will take the other, and we will go <em>forward</em>, with our faces
lifted to Heaven, and will throw that mantle over the emancipated
slaves.</p>

<p>This is the work we propose to do in the South, and wise and
candid men both North and South are beginning to realize that the
education of the negro race is the paramount duty of the nation
to it. Presidents Hayes and Garfield have voiced the feelings of
the North on this subject, while Col. Preston and Dr. Ruffner of
Virginia, Sen. Brown and Pres. Haygood of Georgia, have nobly
re-echoed the sentiment from the South. This Association goes
farther than mere intellectual education. It believes that the
Christian element lies at the foundation of all true character, and
that character is the basis of all true manhood and citizenship.
It has been the aim of this Association not merely to lift up the
individual, but to apply the levers to the elevation of the mass,
and hence it has founded in every large Southern State, schools
fitted for the training of teachers, preachers and missionaries of
the colored race. At Hampton, where the first slave-ship entered
the continent, in the same year in which the Pilgrims landed on
Plymouth Rock, the Association opened the first Freedman’s school
in these United States. Under the energetic administration of Gen.
Armstrong, Hampton Institute, with its broad lands, its large and
commodious buildings, its steam-engine and multiplied mechanical
employments, gives educational and industrial training to its large
company of students, graduating about fifty pupils each year,
ninety per cent. of whom go into the State<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span> as teachers, carrying
with them, into the school, the Sunday-school, the prayer-meeting
and the church a healthful Christian influence; while the noble
old state of Virginia responds to the effort by a gift of $10,000
a year for the support of the school. Atlanta University, with its
two commodious buildings, and another soon to be added, imparts
a higher range of teaching, including classic instruction to its
pupils, and the state of Georgia responds with its gift of $8,000 a
year. If you would see what is done at Fisk University, look around
you and examine the classes under instruction in Jubilee Hall. But
time would fail me to speak of Talladega, Ala.; Tougaloo, Miss.;
Straight University, New Orleans; Tillotson Institute, Austin,
Texas; and of the other schools, normal, grammar and primary, which
the Association sustains. From all these institutions we believe
there are pupils now engaged in teaching, who have under their
care 200,000 children, and that there are pastors in churches that
we have founded, and in others not under our care, whom we have
prepared to be intelligent and faithful preachers of the Gospel in
this land and in Africa. We believe that the providence of God is
bringing to pass a wonderful combination of discovery in Africa
and of Christian education among the Freedmen, that is to have an
immeasurable influence on the long neglected races of the Dark
Continent.</p>

<p>In these efforts for the colored people, we do not wish to make
them vain nor to pauperize them. We believe our efforts have led
thus far to neither of these results. The scholars going from our
schools are not troubled with what is so aptly called the “big
head,” and my observation shows that around our schools and others
like them the colored people are inclined more than anywhere else
to buy land, build houses and make comfortable Christian homes. Our
purpose in erecting these buildings, in addition to the good that
is done to the scholars under immediate instruction, is to inspire
hope in the whole race. And we are doing it. A good colored deacon
in one of our churches said that he expected no greater change to
come over him when he entered Heaven than came over his race when
the doors of the school-house were opened to it.</p>

<p>In the prosecution of this, our great work, we have spent over
$3,000,000, and to secure that sum we have had providential
helpers. First on the roll and steadiest in the ranks are the
Christian friends at the North and in Great Britain, whose firm
support has been the stability of our efforts. We mention also
the Freedmen’s Bureau, with its large and wise distribution of
Government funds for educational purposes. This Bureau has not been
popular at the South; but we believe the time will yet come when
our Southern friends will learn to appreciate the work of Gen.
Howard, the head of this Bureau, and of Gen. Fisk, who administered
so wisely and impartially for both races the Bureau work in this
and adjoining States. The Jubilee Singers need no eulogy in this
presence; their monument stands before us in Jubilee Hall; yet
no list of the providential helpers of this Association, and
especially of Fisk University, could be complete without their
names. And last, but not least, mention must be made of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span> noble
generosity of Mrs. Valeria G. Stone, attested not only in the gift
of $60,000, which is to build Livingstone Hall, whose corner-stone
we lay to-day, but in like gifts throughout the land. God rejoices
in the coming spring, when the frozen ground and the ice-covered
streams give place to the springing grass and the budding leaves,
coming forth to adorn and beautify the earth and to presage the
approaching harvests. And so, without presumption, may His child,
the giver of the bounty which rears this building, be permitted to
rejoice as it sends forth its annual company of students, trained
and adorned for a useful life that shall gladden and bless the
world.</p>

<h3>ANNIVERSARY REPORTS—<span class="smcap">Continued</span>.</h3>

<h4>Atlanta University.</h4>

<p class="secauth">PROF. HORACE BUMSTEAD, D.D.</p>

<p>Anniversary exercises are apt to afford but meagre indication of
the real work accomplished by any school. To those of us who know
the work of Atlanta University, such exercises seem especially
inadequate to the faithful telling of what is being done here.
When our good Christian friend, Philander Veryrich, hints that he
is ready to come down here with a hundred thousand dollars in each
pocket, to be emptied out wherever they will do the most good, I
shall not especially urge his attendance upon our Commencement
exercises. I shall ask him to spend with us either the first or the
last Sunday evening of the school year. I shall beg him to preserve
a strict <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">incognito</i>, and allow me to conceal him outside one of
the windows, or behind one of the doors of our assembly room,
with a peep-hole conveniently arranged. If it is the last Sunday
evening before the vacation, he will hear many of the scholars
speak with grateful appreciation of what the year’s work has done
for them, and with enthusiastic hope of what they mean to do for
others during their summer’s work of teaching. The members of the
graduating class will recall their experience of six or seven or
eight years in the Institution, and tell what a home it has been
to them, and how much of what they have acquired in the training
of mind and character is due to the Christian home influence of
the school. If it is the first Sunday evening of the new school
year, our benevolent friend will hear many of these same scholars
tell of their summer’s work—how they have succeeded in some things
and failed in others; what they have done in Sunday-school and
temperance work; what obstacles they have met and conquered; what
increasing favor they have found in the communities where they
have labored. At either of these Sunday evening family gatherings
(for such they are), I think our visiting friend will be struck
with the simple straightforward way in which our scholars express
themselves, with the extremely limited amount of what is sometimes
called “gush,” and with the clear revelation which will be made to
him that before, behind, around, and underneath everything else,
the development of a thoroughly Christian character, and of a true
manhood and womanhood, is the all-absorbing purpose of our work.
But I am stultifying myself in trying to convey an impression
of these gatherings to others. Even to our own corps of workers
here, they come, twice a year,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span> almost as a surprise and as a most
inspiring revelation to ourselves of what God is permitting us to
do.</p>

<p>And still, however inadequate, our anniversary exercises have been
full of interest, and have revealed much to those who have visited
us for the first time. The Baccalaureate sermon was preached June
12th, by our college pastor, Rev. Cyrus W. Francis, from 1st
Tim. i. 19, “Holding faith and a good conscience;” and it was
an earnest plea for the supremacy of the higher motives in the
Christian warfare upon which the graduates were about to enter.
Three days of public examinations followed, each day’s session
being concluded by an exercise in music and light gymnastics. On
the last day there was a display of what our girls have learned
in the way of head-making. The walls of the front hall and one of
the stairways were covered with specimens of the students’ drawing
and map-making, indicating great progress in this department
during the year. The normal work also has been making a decided
advance. It is evident that those of us who teach the Greek, Latin
and other higher branches will have to look well to our laurels.
Fewer visitors to the school ask to hear the classics translated;
more wish to see how the three R’s are taught. No exercise of
the examination days riveted the attention of our friends more
firmly than the exercise in teaching one of the grammar-school
grades, by one of the members of the senior normal class, with
following criticisms from the other members of the class. However,
we classical instructors rejoice in all this, for we know that
hereafter we shall have better equipped pupils for grappling with
Xenophon and Cicero. It ought to be mentioned here that one of the
most valuable exercises of our winter term this year was a three
days’ Teachers’ Institute, in which all the teachers and scholars
participated, and in which much light was thrown upon the improved
methods of teaching, now attracting such wide attention. A further
impetus was given to thought and effort in this direction by the
visit of our friend, the Rev. A.&nbsp;D. Mayo, co-editor of the <cite>Journal
of Education</cite>, whose four lectures and one sermon before our
students, and whose private talk and counsel with our teachers on
certain phases of our work, will not soon be forgotten.</p>

<p>A very large audience, as usual, packed the Friendship Baptist
church on Thursday, to listen to the essays of eleven of the
graduating class, and to the address of the invited orator of the
day. Five young men and twelve young women received the diplomas of
the school. The Commencement address was delivered by Rev. Atticus
G. Haygood, D.D., President of Emory College at Oxford, in this
State. Those who are now reading his recently published book, “Our
Brother in Black,” will not need to be told that his address was
listened to with the greatest pleasure and approval by all who
were present. It was a plain, forcible and thoroughly wholesome
presentation of some of the ways in which the true greatness of
the State must be secured, and the relation thereto of education
and of such institutions as ours. Dr. Haygood represents, most
nobly, that rapidly multiplying element among the Southern people
which believes in the motto, “Look up and not down, out and not in,
forward and not backward, and lend a hand.” May his tribe increase.</p>

<p>One of the most excellent features of the address was, as one
auditor suggested, the fact that it would have been just as
appropriate for delivery before the Athens (State) University as
before the Atlanta University.</p>

<p>The Alumni meeting, Thursday afternoon, brought together a goodly
number of the graduates of former years. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span> spirit of the remarks
made at this gathering gives, every year, an increasing assurance
of the stability and self-propagating character of the work in
which we are engaged.</p>

<p>The report of the Visiting Committee, appointed by the Governor of
the State, has just been published. It furnishes renewed evidence
of the growing favor which our work is meeting with among the
people of Georgia. The remarks made to the school on the last
day of the examinations, by Rev. Mr. Wilkes, the chairman of the
sub-committee, who prepared this report, were full of good sense
and kindly feeling. The speaker told of his life-long service
as a teacher, and how it had begun with the instruction of a
little colored boy, his father’s slave, in the safe seclusion
of the corn-crib, in the days when such teaching was a criminal
offense. None who heard him could doubt the entire sincerity of
his words of sympathy and encouragement. It is astonishing how
rapidly and widely the work of Atlanta University is coming to be
appreciated. Among the applications for teachers which have lately
been received, have been several from county school commissioners,
who say, in substance, “The teachers we have met with from your
Institution are of such a quality that we desire now to supply all
our schools from the same source.” Let our friends at the North
take courage. Their investments, so far, are bearing compound
interest at a high rate. When these lines reach the eyes of the
readers of the <span class="smcap">Missionary</span>, some ten thousand children, all
over this great State, will be gathered under the instruction of
our pupils. Next October we shall get the reports of this work. As
soon as our friend, Philander Veryrich, will send me his address, I
will give him the date of the Sunday evening gathering, from which
he can learn more about our work than from whole volumes of the
<span class="smcap">American Missionary</span>.</p>

<h4>TALLADEGA COLLEGE.</h4>

<p class="secauth">MRS. THOS. N. CHASE.</p>

<p>After following with tender anxiety so many classes through their
graduating exercises at Atlanta, it has been very pleasant for
me, this year, to witness the closing exercises of two similar
Institutions. This one at Talladega I have been urged to report for
the <span class="smcap">Missionary</span>.</p>

<p>The sermon before the graduating class was preached by Pres. H.
S. De Forest upon the worth of the soul. His eloquent review of
the grand geologic ages told of the greater grandeur of Him for
whom they were prepared. His allusions to the soul’s capacity to
think, feel and choose, to its immortality and cost of redemption,
must have brought to the class an overwhelming sense of their
responsibility. In closing, they were asked to remember that what a
man may be is infinitely more than what he can sell himself to get.</p>

<p>The Missionary Society had the promise of an address on Sunday
evening by Dr. G.&nbsp;B. Willcox, of Chicago Theological Seminary. A
telegram announcing his sickness was throwing its shadow over us,
when, as unexpectedly, Rev. H.&nbsp;M. Ladd dropped in upon us, only
a few days home from Africa. He hastened South to catch the last
days of Talladega and Atlanta sessions, hoping to find recruits for
African missions.</p>

<p>On Monday the examinations began. This Institution is fortunate
in having an excellent primary school in the building. It is a
constant object lesson to the little army of teachers who go out
every summer to teach just such children, and also dignifies
primary work, which, in spite of Frœbel, Pestalozzi and the
truly wise and good everywhere, is too often considered of minor
importance. The principal of the intermediate department has
remarkable ability in bringing her pupils up to her high standard
of excellence. In the rear of her school-room is a power for good
which is inestimable. It consists in a long, low table with seats.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
On it are fastened, by a very simple contrivance, interesting and
instructive illustrated papers and magazines, which the children
are allowed to read after lessons are prepared. In an age when
the best literature floods our land in such cheap forms that the
humblest need never thirst, what nobler philanthropy than to allure
these often worse than homeless children on to an early taste for
good reading?</p>

<p>The normal work and classes in natural science are in charge of a
graduate lately from Beloit College and Whitewater Normal School.
The classical department is in charge of an Olivet graduate, whose
three years here have proved him invaluable. A most interesting
acquisition to the corps of teachers is a scientific farmer, a
graduate of Massachusetts Agricultural College. To enjoy the
delicious vegetables from his garden is enough to convert a sceptic
in scientific agriculture. It really looks as though, under his
skill, these unsightly acres of red clay were, in time, to blossom
as the rose. The joy and pride of this Institution, however, is its
theological department, and well it may be. Its class of eleven
were examined two hours of one of their hot days, and nobody seemed
weary. The clear, simple topics, recited in such an interesting,
lucid style, tolerated no hovering fog, that I had supposed always,
more or less, mystified a recitation in systematic theology. The
accuracy of their knowledge in Bible history, too, was wonderful.
None but a born teacher could have secured such results from
a class of that grade of scholarship. Classes in geometry and
rhetoric told unmistakably of thorough work.</p>

<p>We were entertained, Monday evening, by prize speaking and essay
reading; Tuesday evening, by an interesting account of Mr. Ladd’s
African experience, in place of the expected address by Dr.
Willcox; Wednesday evening, by the ordination of two candidates;
Thursday evening, by a musical concert. There are a few rare voices
here that vocal training would develop into marvellous sweetness.</p>

<p>Thursday was graduating day, and as the class was much smaller
than usual, five young men from the preparatory department gave
orations. They were all excellent in matter and delivery. Their
effect would have been more pleasing, however, had there been a
greater variety of subjects or of treatment. Doubtless, in the
depths of these students’ hearts, no subjects are so momentous as
“The curse of Canaan;” “Cannot we, too, become great men?” “The
ballot,” etc. But what has pleased me here more than anything else,
however, is the excellent spirit manifested by the students in the
family. There is, especially among the young men, an earnestness
of purpose shown that is simply grand. Possibly it is, in part,
owing to the fact that so many are from the country, schooled by
hard work, away from the follies of city life. There is here no
airing of exquisite broadcloth nor swinging of fancy canes. All
are respectful, unassuming, and possessed of a modesty that seems
to reach beneath their delightful demeanor and give them a true
estimate of their abilities. At family devotions, the last morning
before the school separated, one of the graduates led us in prayer.
I cannot think that the thought and tones of that prayer will
ever leave me. The ear of the Omnipotent must have heard those
pathetic pleadings that his fellow-students might be sustained by
the Everlasting Arms as they took up their heavy burdens, often
in the midst of terrible temptations. We who send out these large
numbers of young men and women to reach the masses, feel the need
of your prayers and sympathies; but how much more do these young
and inexperienced ones, as they go out to battle with ignorance,
envy, intemperance and every form of vice! We never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span> realize how
great our hopes are for them till we occasionally get a great shock
by the death of one, or the overcoming and fall of another. We
reach but a few. Surely our work and the entire Southern work of
the American Missionary Association centres in those who go out to
reach the millions. If they fail, we have failed. How important
that we hold up such a high standard of character, that they shall
be beacon lights instead of tapers that shall soon go out in the
darkness.</p>

<h4>TILLOTSON INSTITUTE, AUSTIN, TEXAS.</h4>

<p class="secauth">(From the Daily Statesman)</p>

<p>Tillotson Institute is presided over by the Rev. W.&nbsp;E. Brooks, a
gentleman of evident Christian piety, an accomplished scholar, and
a man thoroughly impressed with the dignity and importance of his
trust. Professor Brooks is ably assisted in the educational part
of his work by Miss Hunt, an experienced and successful teacher of
the young, as her class examinations, conducted at the Institute
on the 9th inst., fully demonstrated; the boys and girls, in the
careful and prolonged examinations to which they were subjected by
their teachers and the visitors present, displaying an accuracy
of information and a fullness of understanding highly commendable
to themselves, and a just source of pride to their faithful and
efficient teachers. The examination in English grammar, including
analysis and parsing, was excellent, as was that also in geography.
The result of the examination in arithmetic, algebra and Latin
showed an uncommon proficiency on the part of the students,
considering the fact that they have been at this school and under
this training scarcely more than six months.</p>

<p>President Brooks has the real welfare of his pupils at heart,
and is educating them in a practical as well as theoretical way.
He is teaching them how to become useful and honorable men and
women, and his labors have the cordial approval of all our best
citizens. President Brooks is so much gratified with his success
thus far that he visits the North shortly, hoping to get further
aid in establishing this school, and proposes, if his expectations
are realized, to add a mechanical and agricultural department
to his present course of instruction. The school closed with an
attendance of one hundred and seven pupils. This under-taking is
a very praiseworthy one, and will, we doubt not, meet with the
encouragement it most certainly deserves. In Virginia, Tennessee
and Louisiana these schools for the colored youth are attracting
the attention and securing the liberal approval of the legislatures
and public men of those states, and so it will be here.</p>

<p>We noticed among the many visitors present at the examination,
Gov. Pease, Rev. Mr. Wright, Judge Fulmore, Mr. A.&nbsp;P. Wooldridge,
Profs. Winn and Johnson, all of whom expressed themselves highly
gratified with the success of the school.</p>

<p>We recommend to our people who take an interest in education
to visit this Institution. They can be assured of a polite and
hospitable welcome, and most of them will be surprised and pleased
to see what a superior school and school building we have in our
midst.</p>

<div class="article">
<h4>AVERY INSTITUTE, CHARLESTON.</h4>

<p>The school year at Avery Institute closed Thursday, June 30, the
last three days being given to public exercises. Tuesday was
“examination day.” I wish you all could see the school as it looked
that morning from the rostrum. The bright eager eyes, the earnest
faces, the neat appropriate style of dress, and the respectful
scholar-like behavior of the students, even the tiniest ones, are
a strong contrast to the appearance of the street children. You
suppose our scholars belong to a better class than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span> the street
children? To be sure they do; but these same lower classes may
become respectable, and have much more to encourage them to rise,
than those had who have already struggled up. The visitors were,
of course, friends of the school and of the scholars, and they
said many kind and appreciative things about the school and the
recitations they heard. We tried to make the examinations strictly
honest. Every scholar was given a chance, as far as possible, to
show what he had done in every study he had pursued; and to take
the words of those who visited the different classes, the result
was satisfactory.</p>

<p>Wednesday was “children’s day,” when the little ones in the lower
rooms gave the entertainment, and the older scholars attended as
guests, with other friends of the small entertainers. The affair
was very child-like and pretty. The recitations and dialogues
were such as the children could appreciate; the songs bright,
airy little things; and the singing a half-shy dainty rippling
of very sweet music. Through all there was no appearance of the
“Now-all-are-looking-at-me” feeling that sometimes makes children’s
exhibitions such pitiful things.</p>

<p>On Thursday was the Anniversary. The course of study having been
extended one year, there was no graduating class. The exercises
consisted of essays by members of the upper classes, the recitation
of a few poems, one or two dialogues, and music. The music was very
good, the dialogues natural, the recitations well chosen and well
spoken, that entitled “Mona’s Water” being very strongly rendered;
but the most interesting part of this entertainment was the essays.
Three prizes had been offered, and three gentlemen of the city
acted as judges, to decide on the merits of the different essays.
All were called good, and with reason. Those of the youngest
class in essay writing were delightfully child-like, natural and
original. That on “Intemperance,” to which the prize was awarded,
had besides a strong-hearted earnestness and depth of thought that
were surprising. The essays of the middle class showed more mature
thought, or, perhaps, a reaching out towards mature thought—a calm
looking forward and trying to prepare for earnest living. The prize
in this class came to the essay entitled, “We Learn not for School,
but for Life.” The essays of the upper class seemed to have for a
key-note a sentiment we always find among the best of our people
here, when we get at their hearts and hopes and aspirations—the
elevation of their race. Do not think there was any sameness in
these essays. Each reached this thought in a different way. It
gleamed out in “Everything was Made to be Happy;” it made itself
felt as one of the foundations of “Progress;” and it formed the
crown of the prize essay, “Nothing Great is Lightly Won,” when,
after brave words calling to action, it closed with the quotation
from Longfellow’s “Psalm of Life:”</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Lives of great men all remind us,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We may make our lives sublime,” etc.,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>leaving one with the thought that helping others is the best and
greatest work here, and that our lives must be right towards God if
we would really help.</p>

<p>In the evening of this same day the Normal exhibition was held.
Every part of the programme was well executed.</p>

<h4>LEWIS HIGH SCHOOL.</h4>

<p class="secauth">REV. S.&nbsp;E. LATHROP, MACON, GA.</p>

<p>The closing examinations occupied nearly two days, May 31st and
June 1st. The attendance of parents and other visitors was larger
than at any previous occasion for some years past, showing perhaps
an increasing interest in educational matters. Most of the older
scholars (about fifteen of them) had left previously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span> to teach
country schools; but the classes which were examined acquitted
themselves remarkably well. The questioning by the teachers threw
them upon their own resources, and proved the excellent instruction
they have had. The noticeable quickness and readiness of answer,
and the mastery of each branch of study, showed that they have
been trained to think for themselves, and not merely to learn
by rote. In reading, geography, history, grammar, composition,
arithmetic, algebra, natural philosophy, and other branches, the
scholars showed very commendable proficiency, and again answered
the often-answered question, “Can the negro learn?”</p>

<p>One thing highly commended by all the visitors, and an important
feature of the instruction, was the constant use of writing.
The scholars spell out their lessons by writing on slate or
black-board. They frequently prepare written compositions or
reviews of lessons in grammar and geography, and in many ways
are taught to express in written characters the thoughts drawn
from their studies. Thus the facts are firmly fixed in mind, and
they learn also by the same process to write, spell, capitalize,
punctuate and compose. Some of the exercises written as ordinary
lessons displayed handsome penmanship.</p>

<p>Several leading white citizens attended the exercises, and
expressed themselves as being much pleased. Among them were
Professor Williams, principal of the State Asylum for the Blind,
located here, a firm friend of negro education; and Professor
Link, a professional teacher of many years’ experience, who said,
significantly, in private: “I attend all the white schools, and
I don’t see any difference”—which is quite an admission for a
native Southerner. There was also Rev. J.&nbsp;W. Burke, a leading
Methodist Episcopal clergyman, publisher and assistant editor of
the <cite>Wesleyan Christian Advocate</cite>, well known as an excellent
Christian man and a true friend of the negro. All the visitors
showed decided interest and pleasure. A violent rain-storm arising
in the afternoon doubtless kept away many who would have attended.</p>

<p>The literary exercises were held in the church at 4 p. m., June
1st, in the presence of a large and attentive audience. The
school, marching in to organ music, were massed together upon the
pulpit platform, one tier above another, making a very striking
and memorable group. As I looked into the bright eyes and smiling
faces of all shades of color, from jet black to almost pure white,
and noted the neat, tasty dress, and the beaming of intelligence
from the animated features, and remembered the thoroughness of
the examination they had passed, I looked back to another scene,
sixteen years ago, when, as a soldier in General Wilson’s cavalry,
we took possession of this city, and heard the rumors of peace
confirmed, just at the end of the long and bloody war. That was
my first sight of the negroes of Macon. Then they were uncouth,
ragged, ignorant and untrained; but now what a change! I thanked
God and took courage.</p>

<p>As the school stood in this grouped position, they sang beautifully
the song “Our Motto,” in which the chorus of each verse was “Be
faithful, firm and true.” Then repeating together the Twenty-third
Psalm, and chanting the Lord’s Prayer, they took their seats in
the body of the church, and the literary programme went on. The
reading of selections and compositions, the declamations and music,
were all well rendered. The singing was especially deserving of
notice, as, on account of the severe illness of Miss Raynor, the
music teacher, the scholars were deprived of their accustomed
organ accompaniment and musical leadership. But they had been
well trained, and acquitted themselves with much credit to their
teacher and themselves. A song entitled “The Farmer’s Boy,” with
a whistling chorus,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span> was especially well sung and whistled. The
senior class sang a parting song, and the benediction by Rev. J.&nbsp;W.
Burke at 6 <span class="smcap lowercase">P.&nbsp;M.</span> closed the arduous and successful year’s
work of the school.</p>

<p>During the year there have been 162 pupils enrolled. Miss C.&nbsp;H.
Gilbert, who has been principal for the past three years, is a very
successful and experienced instructor, and deserves great credit
for the thoroughness and progress of the school. The assistants,
Misses J.&nbsp;A. Raynor and C.&nbsp;M. Park, have also done faithful and
valuable work. The school has almost outgrown its present quarters,
and much needs increased accommodations. The daily Macon <cite>Telegraph
and Messenger</cite> published full and eulogistic reports of the closing
exercises.</p>

<p>Mrs. Elizabeth Lathrop, wife of the Macon missionary, has been
doing an important work in the industrial line among the girls
during the year. Laboring simply as minister’s wife, she has
accomplished a good deal of missionary work, not the least
important of which has been the sewing school. Beginning last
December with twelve pupils, the number increased to 133 on the
roll, with an average weekly attendance of 55. Northern friends
have contributed thread, needles and other material, and during
the seven months the class have made, under the instruction of
Mrs. Lathrop, three hundred and six garments (aprons, dresses,
handkerchiefs and under clothing), besides twenty-six patch-work
quilts, all but three of these completely finished. On June 4th
there was an exhibition of these articles at the Lewis High School,
an astonishment to all who beheld. The mothers sat there with
glad, grateful tears rolling down their cheeks, at the thought
of the benefits received in this manner. Speeches of eulogistic
gratitude were made by the colored Methodist preachers, and the day
closed with the distribution of the garments to the girls who had
made them. Much good has been accomplished in this way, and this
industrial training is receiving, as it should, more attention than
formerly in different places.</p>

<h3>THE ANNIVERSARY AT STOCKTON.</h3>

<p>Last month I gave some account of our anniversary at Sacramento,
with the address by Lem Chung. Last Sabbath evening, June 19th, we
held our anniversary at Stockton. It was an exceedingly interesting
and useful service. The church was well filled—better than ever
before when I have been there. The report of the secretary, Mr.
M.&nbsp;J. Nightingale, and the supplementary one by the teacher, Mrs.
M.&nbsp;B. Langdon, showed good work done with glad results. Just 100
Chinese had been enrolled as pupils in the school during the year,
though the largest enrolment in any one month was 49. The average
attendance on some months rose to 35 or 36, but the average for the
year was 25. Two of the pupils have been baptized and received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
into the Congregational church in Stockton during the year, and
others are now ready to be thus received.</p>

<p>The exercises by the pupils were well rendered. The pastor of the
church, Rev. John Hooper, made an earnest and effective address,
pledging his own sympathy and co-operation in such terms as will be
very helpful to us in the year to come. Your superintendent said
a few words also; but that which thrilled us most of all was the
brief and modest address of our new helper, Lee Pak Yuen, converted
in connection with our Oakland Mission, and a member of the First
Congregational church in that city. I give it to our readers just
as it was uttered.</p>
</div>

<div class="article">
<h4>ADDRESS BY LEE PAK YUEN.</h4>

<p>Dear Friends and Teachers: I am very glad to see you all, but I
have not much to say to you. I can only tell you how I became a
Christian.</p>

<p>For the first three years I was in California I did not like Jesus,
and I did scold those Chinese Christians who spoke about him. I
only liked to go and gamble, and play cards and drink. So I had no
money to live on. I felt very sorry; but afterward I was asked to
come to school, and for many months in school I also talked against
Jesus; but the teacher did not scold me, but was very kind to me.
He taught me, at length, to read this verse in Matt. ix. 13, “For I
am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.” But,
at last, the Holy Spirit convinced me to believe in Jesus with all
my heart, and now I thank you very much for what you have done for
me and for my countrymen. I hope the Lord bless you, and bring many
to believe in the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>I know the Lord is very strong. He helps every one to believe in
Him. Without Him we can do nothing. He will watch over us and take
care of us. Now I will tell you what I did while I was in China.
I left California to go back to China to my father’s house. He
called me to worship the gods, but I would not. My father had made
all preparations for my worshiping. He took my hand to go out of
the door to worship the ancestors, and he wanted me to kneel down
and pray to them. Because I would not, he scolded me and called me
crazy.</p>

<p>I came out to Hong Kong and stopped there one month. I then went
back to my home, and found my father crying, and all very sad. I
asked, “What is the matter?” My father answered: “You are no good.
You come home and will not worship my gods. The gods will kill your
brothers.” I then went to see my brothers, and found one of them
very sick indeed. The doctor said he cannot live two days. I almost
cried myself. My father then said to me: “If he dies I shall kill
you. If I do not kill you, all your other brothers will die.” I
then took my father’s hand, and knelt down and asked the Lord Jesus
to bless him; but my father scolded me all the time, for he did
not believe on the Lord Jesus Christ as our Saviour. He heard my
prayer for my brother’s sickness. In twenty days he was all well.
All the people of my village called me Christ; but I said, I am not
Christ; he is in heaven. The Bible says, “Whatsoever ye shall ask
the Father in my name I will do it.”</p>

<p>My dear friends, I hope you will not forget to pray for China, that
all may be brought to believe in the true God. Let us remember
the promise, “Ask of me, and I will give you the heathen for
thine inheritance, and the uttermost part of the earth for thy
possession.”</p>
</div>

<div class="article">
<h4>THE MAY REPORTS.</h4>

<p>I add the following item, clipped from <cite>The Pacific</cite> of June 8th:</p>

<p>The monthly reports for May from the various mission schools of
the California Chinese mission are very encouraging. The work is
larger and, as we gladly believe, <em>better</em> than ever before—more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
schools, more teachers, more pupils, and, we trust, many souls
seeking Christ. The statistics are as follows: Schools, 14;
teachers and helpers, 27; pupils enrolled, 566; of whom 190 were
received during May, against 68 who left the schools. The aggregate
average attendance was 314. Since the beginning of the present
fiscal year (Sept. 1, 1880), 1,245 pupils have been enrolled. Of
the pupils now in the schools, 136 are reported as giving evidence
of conversion.</p>

<h3>TWENTY MINUTES A-DAY WORKING SOCIETY,</h3>

<p class="secauth">IN CONNECTION WITH THE WOMAN’S HOME MISSIONARY ASSOCIATION.</p>

<p>For the benefit of ladies interested in home missionary work, but
prevented from forming or joining auxiliaries, we have this month a
new plan to propose, a plan which offers some of the advantages of
both individual and co-operative work.</p>

<p>The Twenty Minutes a-Day Working Society originated, we believe,
in England, where it appears to be accomplishing great good. Its
characteristic features are found in other associations among
English ladies, who seem to have a special liking for being bound
together by aim and rules without organization or meetings. But the
idea has been adopted in some of the churches of our country also,
and, it is said, with admirable success.</p>

<p>The following are the rules by which the members of this society
bind themselves:</p>

<p>1. To work twenty minutes a day, or two hours a week, according to
convenience.</p>

<p>2. Each lady to furnish her own materials, and make such articles
as are suitable either for home missionaries and their families at
the West, or for distribution among the colored people.</p>

<p>3. To contribute at least one book a year, not necessarily new.</p>

<p>4. To contribute fifty cents a year for the purpose of defraying
expenses of transportation, &amp;c.</p>

<p>5. To pray each day for those to whom these gifts are sent, and
also for the prosperity of our organization.</p>

<p>6. Articles made are to be sent twice a year to the rooms of the
Woman’s Home Missionary Association, at such times as shall be
designated by the committee.</p>

<p>For further information apply to the Secretary of the Woman’s Home
Missionary Association, 20 Congregational House, Boston.</p>

<p>The interest roused by the late Home Missionary Convention at
Chicago shows how real and earnest is the purpose in the hearts
of many of our people to undertake with new determination and
zeal the task of keeping and of recovering this land for a true
Christianity. Every day exposes anew to us, if our eyes are open,
the monstrous and fatal dangers which threaten our Republic. But
do we consider, does each Christian reflect, that not one of these
evils, not one evil, would endanger our beloved country, if the
good news brought by Christ were accepted and worked out in every
home and every life?</p>

<p>“Ten times one is ten;” yes, there is well unfolded the secret of
Christian life and strength, and of the coming millennium. Let each
of us now say: “I have been saved by the knowledge of Christ; to
how many can I convey this knowledge the coming year? Can I send
it to ten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span> more? to one more? It is not for me to wait to see what
ten others will do. What can I do, and now, to help recover what
is lost, to keep what is yet ours in our dear land?” Oh, let us
try it. We are not doing enough, and our time of working may be
short, if we let the enemy come in like a flood; but let us work,
each work, alone, together; work and pray, for we have already seen
something of what God’s power and goodness can do in multiplying
single-handed and feeble (?) efforts made in His name.</p>

<p>A word more to the children about the Sunday-school papers. A
generous response has come in, but still the Secretary has a large
number of names of schools ready to receive above the number of
those ready to give. Are there not other Sunday-schools with
papers to send? Is there not some girl or boy ready to undertake
to collect the same? Do not be afraid to send a few, if you have
not many, only send them regularly and with prayer. Do not forget
to be “ready to distribute, willing to communicate.” This is your
opportunity as well as that of your father and mother, and the work
is great. Write to the Secretary of the Woman’s Home Missionary
Association, 20 Congregational House, Boston, Mass., and she will
send you the name of a school where the boys and girls will be, you
can hardly think how, eager and glad to get your papers.</p>

<h3>GRACIE’S MISTAKE.</h3>

<p class="secauth">MRS. HARRIET A. CHEEVER.</p>

<p>“Just think, mamma! grandpa Gray gave me a five dollar bill just as
he was getting into the cars to go home, and said I might do just
what I pleased with it; wasn’t that splendid?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Gracie, what shall you do with it?”</p>

<p>“Don’t know yet, shall have to think;” and Gracie flattened her
nose against the window-pane one short moment, the next she
exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Oh, see, ma, there goes one of those colored students; do you
suppose they ever learn much?”</p>

<p>Something in the child’s tone pained Mrs. Gray, and she answered
seriously:</p>

<p>“Just as much as any others; my little girl has yet to learn that
any difference in young men that is only skin deep is a very slight
difference, and none whatever in the sight of God.”</p>

<p>“Well,” replied the petted child, “I like white folks best, and
<em>always shall</em>;” and she gave her pretty head with its fair hair a
smart little toss. Before her mother could reply, she asked hastily:</p>

<p>“May I run across the bit of woods and see Jennie Hale a little
while?”</p>

<p>Her mother said yes, and the next moment Gracie was skipping along
through the “bit of woods” towards the home of her little friend,
when all at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span> once she struck her foot against a little stump,
bounded into the air for an instant, then fell heavily. There she
lay moaning in dreadful pain.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear!” she cried, “I’ve broken my ankle, I know I have, and
that horrid Dr. Stuart will have to set it, and he sha’n’t, he
sha’n’t! I’ll die if he does! Oh, dear, what shall I do!”</p>

<p>Dr. Frank Bates, a colored student in the medical department of the
college for freedmen, close by, was walking slowly along with a
book in his hand—a way these students have, somehow, of improving
every moment—when he thought he heard a moan. He listened, and
sure enough it <em>was</em> a moan, very near, too, and putting the book
in his pocket, he soon reached the spot where Gracie was lying.</p>

<p>He was a very tall, strong young man, but tender-hearted and gentle
as a woman could be. He knelt beside Gracie, who cried with pain
when he tried to lift her.</p>

<p>“There, there,” he crooned pityingly, his great, soft eyes full
of compassion; “wait a moment, and Dr. Frank’ll make it all right
for poor sissy;” and seeing at once what was the real trouble, he
fortunately found a little board, and tearing his bright Madras
handkerchief into strips, with what skill he could carefully
splintered and bandaged the broken limb; then lifting her firmly in
his strong arms, he carried her steadily and safely along to her
home.</p>

<p>Grade’s mother, in all her distress at her little girl’s pain,
did not forget to thank him warmly for what he had done. Then
she added. “Now we will send for Dr. Stuart, and soon have you
comfortable, poor little Gracie.”</p>

<p>But to Mrs. Gray’s surprise, Gracie cried out: “Oh no, no, mamma,
let Dr. Frank stay; I know my limb is broken and must be set all
right; he told me so; but I want Dr. Frank; I’ll be good, only let
him stay.”</p>

<p>Turning to the young giant who stood quietly by, Mrs. Gray asked if
he dared undertake the case, and understood properly what must be
done.</p>

<p>And he proved he did understand perfectly, for not even the famous
Dr. Stuart could more carefully or skillfully have done what was
needed than did Dr. Frank.</p>

<p>Such friends as they grew to be—the dark-skinned, intelligent
young student, and his fair little patient!</p>

<p>One day Gracie said to her father, “Papa, sha’n’t you pay Dr. Frank
just as much for what he has done for me as you should any one
else?”</p>

<p>Mr. Gray thought a moment, then replied:</p>

<p>“Yes, Gracie, I certainly shall; it is only right; he has earned it
as fairly certainly as any one else could have done.”</p>

<p>And what a help and encouragement it was, the handsome sum which
Gracie’s grateful papa paid to Dr. Frank one day. But one other
day, the great tears stood in Dr. Frank’s fine dark eyes, and he
couldn’t say a word for a long time, when Gracie made him a present
of her five dollar bill “to buy a book with, to remember her by,”
she said child-like; but when he could find his voice again, he
said so sadly, that Gracie will never forget it:</p>

<p>“No fear that Dr. Frank will ever forget the first dear white child
who ever gave him kind words and dared trust him. I am very, very
grateful for dear little sissy’s dollars; but oh, the kind words
are the sweetest sounds Dr. Frank has ever heard yet.”</p>

<p>One day Gracie asked her mother if she remembered how proudly she
said she should <em>always</em> like white folks best.</p>

<p>“Yes, I remember,” replied her mother.</p>

<p>“So does God,” said Gracie very gently; “but I’ve been praying Him
to remember it no more, for what <em>should</em> I have done without my
good, kind Dr. Frank?”</p>

<h2>Constitution of the American Missionary Association.</h2>

<p class="section">INCORPORATED JANUARY 30, 1849.</p>

<hr class="chap" />


<p><span class="smcap">Art. I.</span> This Society shall be called “<span class="smcap">The American
Missionary Association</span>.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. II.</span> The object of this Association shall be to
conduct Christian missionary and educational operations, and
diffuse a knowledge of the Holy Scriptures in our own and other
countries which are destitute of them, or which present open and
urgent fields of effort.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. III.</span> Any person of evangelical sentiments,<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> who
professes faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, who is not a slaveholder,
or in the practice of other immoralities, and who contributes to
the funds, may become a member of the Society; and by the payment
of thirty dollars, a life member; provided that children and others
who have not professed their faith may be constituted life members
without the privilege of voting.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. IV.</span> This Society shall meet annually, in the month of
September, October or November, for the election of officers and
the transaction of other business, at such time and place as shall
be designated by the Executive Committee.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. V.</span> The annual meeting shall be constituted of
the regular officers and members of the Society at the time of
such meeting, and of delegates from churches, local missionary
societies, and other co-operating bodies, each body being entitled
to one representative.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. VI.</span> The officers of the Society shall be a President,
Vice-Presidents, a Recording Secretary, Corresponding Secretaries,
Treasurer, two Auditors, and an Executive Committee of not less
than twelve, of which the Corresponding Secretaries shall be
advisory, and the Treasurer ex officio, members.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. VII.</span> To the Executive Committee shall belong the
collecting and disbursing of funds; the appointing, counseling,
sustaining and dismissing (for just and sufficient reasons)
missionaries and agents; the selection of missionary fields;
and, in general, the transaction of all such business as usually
appertains to the executive committees of missionary and other
benevolent societies; the Committee to exercise no ecclesiastical
jurisdiction over the missionaries; and its doings to be subject
always to the revision of the annual meeting, which shall, by a
reference mutually chosen, always entertain the complaints of any
aggrieved agent or missionary; and the decision of such reference
shall be final.</p>

<p>The Executive Committee shall have authority to fill all vacancies
occurring among the officers between the regular annual meetings;
to apply, if they see fit, to any State Legislature for acts of
incorporation; to fix the compensation, where any is given, of all
officers, agents, missionaries, or others in the employment of the
Society; to make provision, if any, for disabled missionaries, and
for the widows and children of such as are deceased; and to call,
in all parts of the country, at their discretion, special and
general conventions of the friends of missions, with a view to the
diffusion of the missionary spirit, and the general and vigorous
promotion of the missionary work.</p>

<p>Five members of the Committee shall constitute a quorum for
transacting business.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. VIII.</span> This society, in collecting funds, in
appointing officers, agents and missionaries, and in selecting
fields of labor and conducting the missionary work, will endeavor
particularly to discountenance slavery, by refusing to receive the
known fruits of unrequited labor, or to welcome to its employment
those who hold their fellow-beings as slaves.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. IX.</span> Missionary bodies, churches or individuals
agreeing to the principles of this society, and wishing to appoint
and sustain missionaries of their own, shall be entitled to do so
through the agency of the Executive Committee, on terms mutually
agreed upon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. X.</span> No amendment shall be made to this Constitution
without the concurrence of two-thirds of the members present at a
regular annual meeting; nor unless the proposed amendment has been
submitted to a previous meeting, or to the Executive Committee in
season to be published by them (as it shall be their duty to do, if
so submitted) in the regular official notifications of the meeting.</p>


<p>FOOTNOTE:</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1" id="Footnote_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> By evangelical sentiments, we understand, among
others, a belief in the guilty and lost condition of all men
without a Saviour; the Supreme Deity, Incarnation and Atoning
Sacrifice of Jesus Christ, the only Saviour of the world; the
necessity of regeneration by the Holy Spirit; repentance, faith and
holy obedience in order to salvation; the immortality of the soul;
and the retributions of the judgment in the eternal punishment of
the wicked, and salvation of the righteous.</p>

<h3>AIM AND WORK.</h3>

<p>To preach the Gospel to the poor. It originated in a sympathy with
the almost friendless slaves. Since Emancipation it has devoted
its main efforts to preparing the <span class="smcap">Freedmen</span> for their
duties as citizens and Christians in America, and as missionaries
in Africa. As closely related to this, it seeks to benefit the
caste-persecuted <span class="smcap">Chinese</span> in America, and to co-operate
with the Government in its humane and Christian policy toward the
<span class="smcap">Indians</span>. It has also a mission in <span class="smcap">Africa</span>.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
